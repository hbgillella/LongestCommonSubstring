# Longest Common Substring

## Project Description

This project implements the Longest Common Substring (LCS) algorithm in C++. The program takes two strings as input and outputs the longest common substring, its length, and the DP (Dynamic Programming) table used to calculate the result.

### Features:
- Calculates the Longest Common Substring (LCS) between two strings of equal length.
- Displays the DP table for debugging and educational purposes.
- Outputs the longest common substring and its length.

## Requirements

To build and run this project, you need the following:
- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`).
- C++ Standard Library.

### Tools and Libraries Used:
- C++ Standard Libraries: `iostream`, `string`, `vector`, `algorithm`

## Usage

### Compilation

To compile the project, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
g++ -o lcs src/main.cpp src/lcs.cpp -I include
